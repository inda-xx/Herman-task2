# üïπÔ∏è Java Adventure Game Development

For this exercise, you will create a simple game application in Java. You will apply object-oriented programming concepts to design and implement features such as player movement, scoring system, and enemy interactions. Prepare to dive into class design and practice your Java programming skills!

### üíÄ Deadline

This assignment is due before the exercise session on **Friday, 23rd September**.

### üë©‚Äçüè´ Instructions

For instructions on how to complete and submit the assignment, please refer to the [assignments section of the course instructions](https://gits-15.sys.kth.se/inda-22/course-instructions#assignments).

### üìù Preparation

To prepare for this assignment, ensure you've read the following material:

- [Introduction to Java Classes](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/index.html)
- Review [Encapsulation and Access Control](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/accesscontrol.html)

> **Assistant's Note:** If you find discrepancies in the course material, it's okay to explore additional examples or resources.

### ‚úÖ Learning Goals

This assignment will help you develop:

* Designing Java classes
* Adding instance fields
* Adding a constructor method
* Creating *getters* and *setters*
* Printing to the terminal
* Using the `main` method
* Understanding scope (or *variable shadowing*)

### üöÄ Assignment: Create Your Java Adventure Game

#### Overview

Create a text-based adventure game where a player can move around, score points, and interact with enemies. Through this assignment, you will build upon your knowledge of Java classes.

#### Exercise 1 -- Player Class

In the `src` folder, create a new class called `Player.java`. Define the following fields:

- `String name`
- `int xPosition` (the horizontal position of the player)
- `int yPosition` (the vertical position of the player)
- `int score`
- `boolean isAlive`

Instantiate the Player class using the `main` method. Print the player's initial state to the terminal.

<details>
  <summary> üõ† Example </summary>

```java
class Player {

  // Put your fields here!

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Player hero = new Player("Hero");

    // Print initial player state
    System.out.println("Player Name: " + hero.name);
    System.out.println("Position: (" + hero.xPosition + ", " + hero.yPosition + ")");
    System.out.println("Score: " + hero.score);
    System.out.println("Is Alive: " + hero.isAlive);
  }
}
```
</details>

#### Exercise 2 -- Getters and Setters

Encapsulate the fields in the `Player` class using private access. Add *getters* and *setters* for each field. Update your `main` method to use these accessors and mutators.

<details>
  <summary> üõ† Example </summary>

```java
class Player {

  // Put your fields here!

  // Put your getters and setters here!

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Player hero = new Player("Hero");

    // Use getters and setters with updated main method.
    hero.setXPosition(5);
    hero.setYPosition(5);
    hero.setScore(10);
    hero.setAlive(true);

    System.out.println("Player Name: " + hero.getName());
    System.out.println("Position: (" + hero.getXPosition() + ", " + hero.getYPosition() + ")");
    System.out.println("Score: " + hero.getScore());
    System.out.println("Is Alive: " + hero.isAlive());
  }
}
```
</details>

#### Exercise 3 -- Constructor

Implement a constructor in the `Player` class that initializes name and starting position. Modify the `main` method to use this constructor.

#### Exercise 4 -- Movement Methods

Add two methods in the `Player` class called `moveUp()` and `moveDown()` to adjust the player's `yPosition`. Print the player's position to the terminal after each move.

#### Exercise 5 -- Enemy Class

Create a new class called `Enemy.java` with appropriate fields for its position (`xPosition` and `yPosition`). Consider how player and enemy might interact. Implement a method in `Player.java` to handle interactions when encountering an enemy. Update the player's score and print relevant messages.

#### Exercise 6 -- Scope and Variable Shadowing

Explore the examples of variable shadowing below. Familiarize yourself with the concept, and be prepared to discuss potential fixes in class. Use the [this](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/thiskey.html) keyword when required.

```java
class Example1 {
    private int value = 10;

    public void demonstrateShadowing() {
        int value = 20;
        System.out.println(value); // It is printing the wrong value
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new Example1().demonstrateShadowing();
    }
}
```

### üèÜ Goals

By completing this assignment, you'll gain practical experience in designing classes, encapsulating data with getters and setters, implementing constructors, addressing variable scope issues, and outputting results to the terminal. 

#### If you encounter any issues during this assignment, consult the following resources:

1. Check this week's [discussion board](https://gits-15.sys.kth.se/inda-22/help/issues) for similar questions.
2. If your problem persists, create a [New Issue](https://gits-15.sys.kth.se/inda-22/help/issues/new) with a descriptive title.
3. Approach a teaching assistant during lab sessions.

Collaborate with classmates for discussions, but remember to **uphold academic integrity** by not sharing solutions. Happy coding!
