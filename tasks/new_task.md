### ‚úÖ Learning Goals

This week, you will learn to:

* Design Java classes
* Add instance fields
* Implement a constructor method
* Create *getters* and *setters*
* Print to the terminal
* Use the `main` method
* Understand scope and solve *variable shadowing*

### üö® Troubleshooting Guide

If you have any questions or issues, follow this procedure:

1. Check this week's [posted issues](https://gits-15.sys.kth.se/inda-22/help/issues). Others might have the same query.
2. If unresolved, create a [New Issue](https://gits-15.sys.kth.se/inda-22/help/issues/new) with a descriptive title starting with "Task *x*: *summary of the problem*".
3. Ask a TA in person during the [weekly lab](https://queue.csc.kth.se/Queue/INDA).

Discuss with peers but **do not share code**!

### üèõ Assignment

You are tasked with creating a simple console-based game, encompassing core gameplay elements: player movement, a scoring system, and enemy interactions. Design Java classes to represent each component interactively within the game.

#### Exercise 1 -- Designing Classes and Fields

In the `src` folder, create the following Java classes:

- **Player**
  - Fields: `String name`, `int health`, `int score`, `Position position`
  - The `Position` class (nested or separate) should maintain `int x`, `int y`.

- **Enemy**
  - Fields: `String type`, `int health`, `Position position`

- **GameWorld**
  - Fields: `Player player`, `Enemy[] enemies`

#### Exercise 2 -- Constructor Method and Printing

Implement constructors for `Player`, `Enemy`, and `GameWorld` that take relevant initial values. Ensure you print initial states to the terminal.

<details>
  <summary>Example Initialization</summary>

  ```java
  public class Example {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          Player player = new Player("Hero", 100, new Position(0, 0));
          Enemy goblin = new Enemy("Goblin", 50, new Position(5, 5));
          GameWorld world = new GameWorld(player, new Enemy[]{goblin});

          // Print player and enemy information
          System.out.println("Player: " + player.getName() + " at " + player.getPosition());
          System.out.println("Enemy: " + goblin.getType() + " at " + goblin.getPosition());
      }
  }
  ```
</details>

#### Exercise 3 -- Getters and Setters (Encapsulation)

Add getters and setters for all fields, which will prevent direct access to class properties while allowing modifications through controlled methods.

```java
// Example getter and setter for Player's health
public int getHealth() {
    return this.health;
}

public void setHealth(int health) {
    this.health = health;
}
```

#### Exercise 4 -- Player Movement and Score

Develop methods in the `Player` class to move (up, down, left, right) and update the score when reaching certain positions.

#### Exercise 5 -- Enemy Interactions

Implement functionality in the `Enemy` class for interaction with the player (e.g., inflict damage). Print the player's remaining health when attacked.

<details>
  <summary>Simple Interaction Example</summary>

  ```java
  public void attack(Player player) {
      int damage = 10;
      player.setHealth(player.getHealth() - damage);
      System.out.println(player.getName() + " was attacked and now has " + player.getHealth() + " health.");
  }
  ```
</details>

#### Exercise 6 -- Scope and Variable Shadowing

Understand the concept of variable shadowing using the examples below. Be prepared to discuss in class:

```java
public class ScopeExample {
    private int counter = 100; // Global variable

    public void demonstrateShadowing() {
        int counter = 10;  // Local variable shadows the global one
        System.out.println(counter); // Prints 10
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new ScopeExample().demonstrateShadowing();
    }
}
```

Reflect on how the keyword `this` can resolve shadowing issues in constructors:
```java
public class GameObject {
    private String name;

    public GameObject(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}
```

> **Assistant's Note:** Consider implications of local and global variable shadows and how to maintain clarity in code with careful variable naming and use of `this`.

With these exercises, you're building a foundation for understanding object-oriented programming principles within the context of a simple game. Enjoy the challenge, and may it spark further curiosity and learning!
