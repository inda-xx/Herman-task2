### üèõ Assignment

Embark on a coding journey to build a simple game prototype with three core mechanics: player movement, scoring, and enemy interactions. You'll design three classes: `Player`, `Enemy`, and `Game`. 

#### Example Structure

- **Player** will have position, score, and methods for movement.
- **Enemy** will interact and affect the player's score.
- **Game** will manage interactions and track the game's state.

#### Exercise 1: Designing Classes

Create `Player.java`, `Enemy.java`, and `Game.java` with fields:

- `Player`: `int x, y`, `int score`
- `Enemy`: `int x, y`
- `Game`: `Player player`, `Enemy enemy`

Implement these steps:

1. **Fields**: Initialize variables inside classes.
2. **Print Statements**: Add print statements for field values in `main` methods.
3. **Constructors**: Add constructors for each class to initialize object parameters.

#### Exercise 2: Getters and Setters

Encapsulate fields by making them private. Implement getters and setters:

- Example for Player:
  ```java
  public class Player {
      private int x, y;
      private int score;

      public int getX() { return x; }
      public void setX(int x) { this.x = x; }

      // Similarly, add for y and score.
  }
  ```

- Verify by printing player‚Äôs coordinates and score.

#### Exercise 3: Main Method Integration

In `Game.java`, manage invocation:

- Initialize `Player` and `Enemy`.
- Demonstrate movement and score adjustment.
- Use print statements to debug positions and scores.

#### Exercise 4: Variable Shadowing and Scope

Understand variable shadowing by reviewing examples. Fix issues by ensuring correct scope access:

```java
public class Example {
    private int value = 10;

    public void showValue() {
        int value = 5;  // Local variable shadows instance field
        System.out.println(this.value);
    }
}
```

Use such concepts to ensure proper encapsulation and method utilization in your game project.

### Variable Shadowing Examples

Explore scope issues and address using `this`:

```java
public class Example {
    private String name;

    public Example(String name) {
        this.name = name; // Correct usage of 'this' to reference the instance variable
    }

    public void printName() {
        String name = "Temp";
        System.out.println(this.name); // Accesses the instance variable
    }
}
```

**Think carefully about local versus instance scope, avoiding shadowing inadvertently.**

### üåü Completion Steps

Test your game to ensure functionality of movement, scoring, and enemy interaction. Compile cleanly and ensure all printouts reflect logical operations.

Good luck, and have fun building your basic game prototype! This is a crucial step in understanding object-oriented programming and Java application design.
