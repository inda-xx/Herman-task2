# Java Adventure: Simple Game Development

For this exercise, you are going to practice designing an object-oriented game in Java. You will create a simple console-based game application featuring player movement, a scoring system, and interactions with basic enemies. This project is intended to acquaint you with developing Java classes, handling instance fields, using constructors, and managing scope.

### üíÄ Deadline

Collaborate with peers for understanding the concepts, but avoid sharing exact solutions.

### üèõ Assignment

Embark on a Java adventure by creating a basic game in the console. You will design the core of this game using Java classes that model players, score systems, and enemy interactions. 

#### Exercise 1.0 -- Player Class

In the `src` directory, create a new class `Player.java`. Your player must have the following instance fields:

- `String` playerName
- `int` score
- `int` positionX
- `int` positionY

Provide getters and setters for each field, and initialize these fields using a constructor. The `main` method in Example 1 should compile correctly with your class.

<details>
  <summary>üõ† Example 1</summary>

  ```java
  public class Player {
      
      // Declare instance fields
    
      // Constructor here
      
      // Getters and setters here

      public static void main(String[] args) {
          Player player1 = new Player("Hero", 0, 5, 5);

          // Print player's initial position
          System.out.println("Player: " + player1.getPlayerName());
          System.out.println("Position: (" + player1.getPositionX() + ", " + player1.getPositionY() + ")");
          System.out.println("Score: " + player1.getScore());
      }
  }
  ```
</details>

#### Exercise 1.1 -- Game Logic

Create a `Game` class with a `main` method to initialize your game. Add methods to move the player. Implement terminal commands to move the player via input and update their position.

<details>
  <summary>üõ† Example 2</summary>

  ```java
  public class Game {
      
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          Player player1 = new Player("Hero", 0, 5, 5);
          
          // Basic game loop for player movement
          Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
          System.out.println("Enter move (w/a/s/d):");

          while (true) {
              String move = scanner.nextLine();
              
              switch (move) {
                  case "w": player1.setPositionY(player1.getPositionY() + 1); break;
                  case "s": player1.setPositionY(player1.getPositionY() - 1); break;
                  case "a": player1.setPositionX(player1.getPositionX() - 1); break;
                  case "d": player1.setPositionX(player1.getPositionX() + 1); break;
              }

              System.out.println("New Position: (" + player1.getPositionX() + ", " + player1.getPositionY() + ")");
          }
      }
  }
  ```
</details>

#### Exercise 1.2 -- Score System

Introduce scoring by adding a method to update and display the player‚Äôs score. Update it based on player actions (e.g., successful moves).

#### Exercise 1.3 -- Enemy Interaction

Design a class `Enemy` with attributes like position and effects on the player. Implement interactions where a player can encounter an enemy, and trigger events (like reducing health points or resetting score). Ensure instance variables have proper encapsulation with getters and setters.

<details>
  <summary>üõ† Example 3</summary>

  ```java
  public class Enemy {
    
      // Declare enemy attributes

      // Constructor here

      // Getters and setters here

      public void interact(Player player) {
          // Interaction logic (e.g., adjust player's score)
          System.out.println("Encountered an enemy!");
      }
  }
  ```

  ```java
  public class Game {
      
      // Main and other methods continue here

      private static void checkEnemyEncounter(Player player, Enemy enemy) {
          if (player.getPositionX() == enemy.getPositionX() && player.getPositionY() == enemy.getPositionY()) {
              enemy.interact(player);
          }
      }
  }
  ```
</details>

#### Exercise 1.4 -- Handling Variable Shadowing

Ensure you manage variable shadowing, particularly when handling player actions and enemy interactions. Use appropriate scope references or the `this` keyword where necessary.

Review these examples to solidify your understanding:

```Java
public class ScopeExample {
    private int level = 0;

    public void printLevel() {
        int level = 10;
        System.out.println(this.level); // Intends to print the field level
    }
}
```

> **Note:** Understand how the scope affects which variable is accessed, especially when local variables have the same name as instance fields.

#### Conclusion

Create a creative visual narrative using printed messages in the terminal to represent changes in the player's journey. The game doesn't have to be overly complex; focus on structuring your Java classes properly and utilizing OOP principles. Happy Coding!
