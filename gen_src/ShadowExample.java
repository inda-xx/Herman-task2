Here's a revised version of the Java code template, with improved structure and formatting. This version provides clear placeholders for the students to implement:

```java
public class ShadowExample {

    // TODO: Declare necessary fields if any.

    // TODO: Implement this method.
    public void shadowMethod() {
        // TODO: Implement this method.
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // TODO: Implement this method.
    }
}
```

### Key Points of the Revision:
1. **Comments**: Made sure the comments indicate where implementations are needed, reducing redundancy but ensuring clarity.
2. **Fields Section**: Added a comment placeholder for field declarations, as they might be relevant for class-level variables.
3. **Indentation**: Ensured consistent indentation for readability.
4. **Method Definitions**: Made sure `shadowMethod` and `main` are distinct in their purposes based on standard practice.
