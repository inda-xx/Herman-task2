Here's a revised version of the template with proper formatting and structure:

```java
public class Character {

    // Fields
    private String role;

    // Constructor
    public Character(String role) {
        // TODO: Implement the constructor.
        this.role = role;
    }

    // Methods
    // TODO: Implement additional methods required for the Character class.
}
```

### Key Adjustments:
- Added a placeholder field `private String role;` to ensure there's a clear indication of where class data members could be declared.
- Clarified the types of the existing comments, indicating there are fields, a constructor, and methods to develop.
- Aligned comments to specify where specific implementations are needed.
